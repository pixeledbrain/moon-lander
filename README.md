# Moon Lander
for [Game Off 2020](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020)

Theme was "Moonshot".

&nbsp;

## Info:

Platforming game where you control a moon lander. Only controls are to apply rotation and thrust to the ship. Use this to navigate each level and reach the goal. You can pick up collectables that increase your score, but it does nothing.

My first real project, and first Game Jam, so I went small. Hope you enjoy it!

## Story:

An infinite energy source was discovered on Earth, however, it can't store much energy at once. You control a Shuttle equipped with said energy source, and your objective is to use it to reach the moon to ... .

## Controls:

Action | Key 1 | Key 2
:---: | :--- | :---
Thrust | Up | Space
Rotate Clockwise | Right | 
Rotate Anticlockwise | Left | 
Reset Level | R |
